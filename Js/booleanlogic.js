// Boolean logic is a branch of computer science that uses true and false values to solve complex logical problems. To do that, it uses several logical operators to combine true and false values. Arithmetic operators to combine numeric values.

// Basic boolean logic
// 1. AND 
// 2. OR
// 3. NOT


// AND OPERATOR

// we make use of truth table
const a = "Sarah has a driver's license";
const b = 'Sarah has a good vision';


// AND operator returns true only if A and B are both true.

// It returns false when A and B are both false

// No matter how many variables, it will only return true if all of them are true.

// If one of the variable is false then all of them would be false as well.


// OR OPERATOR

// we use the OR operator to know if sarah has a driver's liscense or good vision.
