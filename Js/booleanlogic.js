// Boolean logic is a branch of computer science that uses true and false values to solve complex logical problems. To do that, it uses several logical operators to combine true and false values. Arithmetic operators to combine numeric values.

// Basic boolean logic
// 1. AND 
// 2. OR
// 3. NOT


// AND OPERATOR

// we make use of truth table
// Sarah has a driver's liscence AND good vision


// AND operator returns true only if A and B are both true.

// It returns false when A and B are both false

// No matter how many variables, it will only return true if all of them are true.

// If one of the variable is false then all of them would be false as well.


// OR OPERATOR

// we use the OR operator to know if sarah has a driver's liscense or good vision.

// even if one of the variables is false, the outcome will still be true
// if either A or B is true then the outcome will become true


// if we have mutiple variables, it is enough for one of them to be true to make the whole operation to become true as well


// NOT OPERATOR

// it doesn't combine multiple values instead it acts on only one boolean value. it inverts it true/false value

// if A is true, it will become false and if it is false then NOT A will become true


let age = 16;
const A = 'Age is greater or equal 20';  //false
const B = 'Age is less than 30';  //true

// use operators
// !A = true;

//  A AND B = false;
// A is false and B is true so it will be false because AND operator can only be true if the two variables are both true.

// A OR B = true;
// A is false and B is true. According to OR truth table, if one variable is true and the other 

// !A AND B = true;
// !A is true and B is true which makes it true.

// A OR !B = false;
// A is false and B is true so !B will be false. in the OR table, false OR false will be false.
