// A value is a piece of data. It is the most fundamental piece of information that we have in programming. Example; 'Jonas' is a value

console.log("Jonas");
console.log(23);

// A value is a smallest unit of information that we have in javascript.

// We can store values in variables and we can reuse them over and over again

let firstName = "Matilda";
// The code written above is called declaring a variable. Let will create a real variable in your computer memory and it will store the value "Jonas" in the variable that is being created.
console.log(firstName);
console.log(firstName);
console.log(firstName);
console.log(firstName);
// we use console.log whenever we want to output result to the webpage

// Variables is a container used to store a value.

// conventions and rules to name variables
// 1. camelCase - Example; firstName
// 2. you can't start variables with a number
// 3. Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, underscores or dollar sign

//4. new is a reserved keyword in javascript and cannot be used to name variables
// let new = 27;

//5. same thing with function
// let function = 27;

//6. name is  kind of a reserved key word too.

//7. Do not start a variable name with an uppercase letter

// Variables that starts with uppercase are reserved for constants that we know will never change.
let PI = 3.1415;

// 8. Make sure your variable names are descriptive and easy to understand for cleaner and clearer codes.
// Example;
let myFirstJob = 'Programmer';
let myCurrentJob = 'Teacher';

console.log(myFirstJob);
console.log(myCurrentJob);

// Assignment

let myCountry = 'Nigeria';
let myContinent = 'Africa';
let myPopulation = '12 billion';

console.log(myCountry);
console.log(myContinent);
console.log(myPopulation);
