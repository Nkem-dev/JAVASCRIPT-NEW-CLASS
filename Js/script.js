let js = 'amazing';
        if (js === 'amazing') alert('Javascript is FUN!');

        // how to see results from our code back in the browser
        40 + 8 + 23 -10;
        // the reason why this code did'nt show in the console unlike before is because the console is an environment that is used to execute small pieces of code and then show results immediately.

        // if you want the code written above to display results in the console, you have to tell javascript to output that result

        // the special function used to output the result is;
        console.log( 40 + 8 + 23 -10);
         // with this, we will get the output of this code printed to the console.
