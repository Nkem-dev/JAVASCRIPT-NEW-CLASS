// an expression is a piece of code that produces a value

// 3 + 4 is an expression because it is going to produce a value.
// 1991 is an expression even though it is just a simple value. it will produce a value in javascript
// true && false && !false is an expression because it will produce a boolean value. 

// a statement is a bigger piece of code that is executed and does not produce a value on itself.

// the declaration is like a complete sentence and expression is like the words that make up the sentences.

// We write our codes as a sequence if actions and these actions are statements

if(23 > 10){
    const str = '23 is bigger';
}

// This ifelse statement is a statement and the same is true for a switch statement

// the statement above doesn't really produce a value. it simply declares the variable 'str'. it performs an action, in this case , declaring a variable but t doesn't produce a value.

// the 'str' is an expression

// const str = '23 is bigger'; is a statement because it doesn't produce any value.

// anything that ends with a semicolon ; is a statement.
// in a template literal, you can only insert expressions but not a statement.

const me = 'Jonas';
console.log(`I'm ${2037 - 1991} years old ${me}`);



// statements are full sentences that translates the actions that we want the program to perform.
